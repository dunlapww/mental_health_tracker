# Note of note
This is my first attempt at building an app.  
I appreciate any feedback or interest in contributing to the project.
All feedback needs to be constructive and kind.  

# Mental Health Tracker App
This is a mental health tracker app that allows you to track your mood over a period of time.
The app prompts the user to fill out the same questionnaire on a consistent basis ( likely weekly).
A score is then generated from your answers.  The number attempts to quantify your mood.  A lower number reflects a depressed mood, a higher number reflects a happier mood.
By tracking this number of time you can establish an idea of your baseline mood.
Then as you begin to incorporate therapy and/or medication into your routine you can begin to see the improvements (or not) against your baseline mood.
This app will allow you to also document and track your medication types, dosages, as well as any triggering events (that may cause mood swings), therapy sessions, meditation etc, to help you better understand drivers to your general mood.


I was inspired to build this app as someone who has dealt with mood issues and struggled to distinguish the benefits of medication vs placebo vs triggering events vs different medications.
I did try and track this detail manually in Excel which I found helpful, but it was cumbersome so I was inconsistent.  My hope is that by making this easy to use, I will see improvements.
